//**Vue Routing**

**Most sites have more than one page**

-Recall that Vue (and React and Angular) are "single page web apps"
-Are you only able to create one page?
-No, your app can appear to have many pages
-There is technically only one page, but the content shown in that page can
    completely change
-To enable this, need to use a router to describe a URL for each page;
    each page will be associated with a component
-This component can have child components, as usual
-In a Vue app, when navigating to another page, use the router to change pages
    and load the component for that page
-This is similar, but not the same, as routing on the server
-Server routing and client routing are completely independent

//**50 States**
-Uses vue-router to navigate between the pages
-PostgreSQL database to store data about each state
-Uses the same component for the header and footer for each page
